I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at Georgia tech, advised by [Prof. Alberto Dainotti](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/) and [Prof. Ahmed Saeed](https://saeed.github.io/). My research interests lie in network measurement and systems. 

Reserch Interests

Network Measurement Systems  
Distributed Systems 

Current Work

Currently, I‘m working on the interdomain congestion measurement. Interdomain congestion happens between different internet service providers and affects millions of users. We are developing a new congestion measurement system utilizing users’ speed test data around the world to significantly reduce internet latency.
